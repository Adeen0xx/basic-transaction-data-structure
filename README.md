hiii.

overview.

the idea for this is to simulate the performance improvements enabled by monad's deferred execution model in comparison to ethereum sequential execution model. by decoupling execution from consensus, monad achieves higher throughput (tps), reduce latency and parrallelization of execution. the simulation is designed to compare both approach under identical conditions and visualize the results.

features.

tps simulation: measure and compare transactions processed per seconds by both model'
latency measurement: track the time from transaction submission to execution outcome.
execution-consensus parallelization : analyze the time saved from decoupling execution from consensus phases.
dynamic inputs: configure block size transaction volume and network latency for realistic scenarios.

thank youuu
